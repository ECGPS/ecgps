These topics are not only central to understanding human decision-making and adaptive behavior but also hold significant implications for mental health, education, and artificial intelligence.</p><p data-v-4e58e03c>The symposium will feature a diverse program, including keynote presentations, interactive discussion sessions, and opportunities for one-on-one or group meetings. We are honored to host an exceptional lineup of speakers, including the academy member Dr. Amy Arnsten (Yale University), Dr. Haruhiko Bito (Tokyo University), and many other distinguished experts from institutions such as Janelia Research Campus, the Polish Academy of Sciences, Jiao Tong University, ShanghaiTech University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p data-v-4e58e03c>In addition to fostering interdisciplinary and international collaborations, this symposium will serve as a platform for students, postdocs, and early-career scientists to engage in meaningful scientific dialogue with established leaders in the field. By initiating this academic activity, we hope to draw attention to the unique and underexplored topic of give up/perseverance behavior among researchers and the broader public, ultimately advancing our understanding of the brain and behavior.</p><p data-v-4e58e03c>We are thrilled to welcome you to Shanghai, a city that seamlessly blends tradition and innovation, and to the Institutes of Brain Science at Fudan University, a hub for cutting-edge research in neuroscience.</p><p class="highlight-text" data-v-4e58e03c>We look forward to your participation and contributions to this pioneering event.</p></div><div class="organizers-section" data-v-4e58e03c><h3 data-v-4e58e03c>Organizing Committee</h3><div class="divider-small" data-v-4e58e03c></div><p data-v-4e58e03c>Dr. Na De, Dr. Yu Gu, Dr. Yue Li, Dr. Jifen Shi (Fudan University) and Dr. Tifei Yuan (Shanghai Jiao Tong University).</p></div></div><div class="copyright-info" data-v-4e58e03c><p data-v-4e58e03c>Â© 2025 First Symposium on Emotion and Cognition.
